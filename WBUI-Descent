At the height of our community, we had over 51 servers across 4 clusters. \r\n\r\nWe're in the process of rebuilding after Aardwolf passed away in October, 2024. \r\n\r\nWe are hosted on Nitrado, and depend on donations to continue. We've reduced to 3 clusters with 2 maps each until we receive further donations, or when Rebelweasel has a home again! \r\n\r\nHere is a brief description of all clusters within My Other Arks. Each one is carefully tuned to a different range of difficulty and play-style.\r\n\r\n<TextStyle.White>---ASA CLUSTER---</>\r\n<RichColor Color=\"0,0,1,1\">My Other Descent (to Madness)</>\r\nHighly difficult cluster built around the dino overhaul mod \"ARK Descended\". \r\n \r\n- Crossplay\r\n- 2 maps\r\n- Astraeos DLC Permanent Base Map\r\n- Second map rotates each month\r\n- Medium level character progression and XP\r\n- Hard level dinosaur danger and survival.\r\n- Automation\r\n- Passive Resource Generation\r\n- Easiest for Dino breeding with Crazy's Potions for Gender Change, Instant Grow, Skip Breeding Timer, etc.\r\n- Best Gear crafted through the Descent mod, or gathered from Supply Drops.\r\n\r\n\r\n<RichColor Color=\"0,0,1,1\">My Other Life ASA [LifeASA]</>\r\n- PC & Consoles. \r\n- High Level QoL focus so you can reach end-game quickly.\r\n- The easiest of all our ASA servers. \r\n- #1 of 3 ASA servers for quickest progression. \r\n- #1 of 3 clusters for easiest dino survival.\r\n- Automation.\r\n- Passive resource generation systems.\r\n- Easiest and quickest automated breeding with potions for Gender Change, Instant Grow, Skip Breeding Timer, etc. \r\n\r\n<TextStyle.White>---OUR ORIGINAL ASE CLUSTER---</>\r\n<RichColor Color=\"0,0,1,1\">Aardwolf's Spirit ASE [AASpirit]</> \r\n- PC Epic & Steam cross-play. \r\n- No mods, but boosted stats.\r\n"

We refuse to bloat our rules for every single circumstance which might come up. Learn our rules, and follow the simple guideline we use when we formed our server rules: \"Am I inconveniencing other players?\" \r\n \r\n- No offensive names for anything. Names must use normal English alphabet characters, no special symbols or emoji. \r\n\r\n- Verbal/Text harassment of others will get you banned. \r\n\r\n- Picking up players, dragging players, dropping or kiting dinos to people or bases is forbidden. To protect yourself, we recommend you log out in a bed so others cannot drag you. People can and do still mesh into people's bases.\r\n\r\n- Do not interfere with a dino that another player is taming.\r\n"

If your base is built on a player spawn point, you will be asked to move or unlock it. \r\n\r\n- Resource/Artifact Teleports, Oil Pumps, Gas Collectors, and SirM8 storages at location, should ALWAYS be public & unlocked. \r\n\r\n- Do not make your Teleport pads inside tek shields or locked bases “public”.\r\n\r\n- Bases should not obstruct major passage points on a map like rivers or tunnels between map sections or leading to the space zone on Gen2 for example.\r\n\r\n- Trains ARE NOT WHITELISTED YET. They will disappear until I can figure out how to whitelist them. "

Tame it, or kill it if you decide you don't want it.\r\n\r\n- If you no longer want an animal, you must find it a new home or destroy it. Do not leave it unclaimed.\r\n\r\n- DO NOT drop any Wyvern, Drake, Deino, Magmasaur, Rock Drake, etc eggs. Dropping them in lava does not destroy them. They take too long to decay and will prevent respawn of new eggs in nests. DESTROY or CONSUME them."
