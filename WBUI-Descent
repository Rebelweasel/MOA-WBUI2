If your base is built on a player spawn point, you will be asked to move or unlock it. \r\n\r\n- Resource/Artifact Teleports, Oil Pumps, Gas Collectors, and SirM8 storages at location, should ALWAYS be public & unlocked. \r\n\r\n- Bases should not obstruct major passage points on a map like rivers or tunnels between map sections or leading to the space zone on Gen2 for example.\r\n\r\n<RichColor Color=\"1, 0, 0.65, 1\">Element Catalyst Farms</>\r\n- Element farms are limited to 6x6 foundations, or 3x3 vacuum cubes. \r\n- You must meet with an admin to set up your element farm.

NO they do not despawn if you drop them. Nor are they damaged in lava.\r\n\r\n- Animals should not be left unattended outside your base. If you've lost connection, you can file a Help Ticket.

Blueprints are exact copies with the same Creature ID#, so if a person pulls their dino to them using dino finder, it might pull someone else's instead that shares the same ID#. Only use blueprint animals for breeding, or emergency backups.\r\n\r\n- Empty Beaver dams completely, even if you have to dump stuff on the ground, so that they respawn full for other players. No, beavers do not refill them!"
