						"text": "My Other Arks continues the legacy begun by Aardwolf in 2017 with his multiple clusters for ARK Survival Evolved. At the height of our community, we had over 51 servers across 4 clusters. \r\n\r\nWe're in the process of rebuilding after Aardwolf passed away in October, 2024. \r\n\r\nWe have one to four maps up for each of the original 5 clusters that existed at the time of Aardwolf's passing, and some of the original server components to begin rebuilding! The only limit on having our clusters rebuilt to where they were is the time for Rebelweasel to physically put them together. \r\n\r\nWe have 2 ASE servers and 2 ASA servers. \r\nAll ASA servers have within-game Cluster & Discord Cross-Chat. \r\n\r\nHere is a brief description of all clusters within My Other Arks. Each one is carefully tuned to a different range of difficulty and play-style.\r\n\r\n<TextStyle.White>---ASA CLUSTERS FOR DIFFERENT PLAY STYLES---</>\r\n<RichColor Color=\"0,0,1,1\">My Other Home [Home]</>\r\n- PC Only. \r\n- Build, deco, some custom dinos. \r\n- Heavily modded, slow progression. \r\n- #2 of 2 ASA clusters for slowest character progression. \r\n- #2 of 2 ASA clusters for dino survival difficulty.\r\n- Only Automation is item sorting and crop maintenance. No automation for anything a dino can do for you.\r\n- Medium level breeding difficulty, more costly mutations and potions for convenience. No automated egg pickups, incubations, and baby nannies when dinos can do it for you!\r\n\r\n<RichColor Color=\"0,0,1,1\">My Other Life ASA [LifeASA]</>\r\n- PC & Consoles. \r\n- High Level QoL focus so you can reach end-game quickly.\r\n- The easiest of all our ASA servers. \r\n- #1 of 3 ASA servers for quickest progression. \r\n- #1 of 3 clusters for easiest dino survival.\r\n- Automation.\r\n- Passive resource generation systems.\r\n- Easiest and quickest automated breeding with potions for Gender Change, Instant Grow, Skip Breeding Timer, etc. \r\n\r\n<TextStyle.White>---OUR ORIGINAL ASE CLUSTERS---</>\r\n<RichColor Color=\"0,0,1,1\">Aardwolf's Spirit ASE [AASpirit]</> \r\n- PC Epic & Steam cross-play. \r\n- No mods, but boosted stats.\r\n\r\n<RichColor Color=\"0,0,1,1\">My Other Life ASE [LifeASE]</> \r\n- PC Steam Only. \r\n- High Level QoL focus so you can reach end-game quickly."
