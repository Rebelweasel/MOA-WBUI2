						"text": "My Other Arks continues the legacy begun by Aardwolf in 2017 with his multiple clusters for ARK Survival Evolved. At the height of our community, we had over 51 servers across 4 clusters. \r\n\r\nWe're in the process of rebuilding after Aardwolf passed away in October, 2024. \r\n\r\nWe are hosted on Nitrado, and depend on donations to continue. We've reduced to 2 clusters with 2 maps each until we receive further donations, or when Rebelweasel has a home again! \r\n\r\nHere is a brief description of all clusters within My Other Arks. Each one is carefully tuned to a different range of difficulty and play-style.\r\n\r\n<TextStyle.White>---ASA CLUSTER---</>\r\n<RichColor Color=\"0,0,1,1\">My Other Life ASA [LifeASA]</>\r\n- PC & Consoles. \r\n- High Level QoL focus so you can reach end-game quickly.\r\n- The easiest of all our ASA servers. \r\n- #1 of 3 ASA servers for quickest progression. \r\n- #1 of 3 clusters for easiest dino survival.\r\n- Automation.\r\n- Passive resource generation systems.\r\n- Easiest and quickest automated breeding with potions for Gender Change, Instant Grow, Skip Breeding Timer, etc. \r\n\r\n<TextStyle.White>---OUR ORIGINAL ASE CLUSTER---</>\r\n<RichColor Color=\"0,0,1,1\">Aardwolf's Spirit ASE [AASpirit]</> \r\n- PC Epic & Steam cross-play. \r\n- No mods, but boosted stats.\r\n"
